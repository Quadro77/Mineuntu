as of 12/05/2024 gpu drivers need Ubuntu 22 HWE

## To Do

* Automate Driver Install

- [ ] Intel Drivers
* Automate Miner installs with root user privileges
- [ ] lolMiner
- [ ] BZMiner
- [x] SRBMiner 
- [ ] XMRig (Change dev fee)
* Resume from reboot
- [ ] Resume previous mining on reboot
* Have temperature-controlled on/off function (heating house/water/greenhouse/etc)
- [ ] Motherboard temperature sensor to pause/resume mining
- [ ] GPU temperature sensor to pause/resume mining
- [ ] External temperature sensor to pause/resume mining
- [ ] Ramp down mining by turning off each card
* A Locally installed GUI (Python 3)
- [ ] Monitor GPUs
- [ ] Monitor Motherboard sensors, CPU, Memory, etc
* Web scrape for best yield (yield switching)
* https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti
* (using nicehash might be the best as it depends on overclock setting miner software etc
* Auto-tune GPUS for best power consumption, best performance, balanced##
