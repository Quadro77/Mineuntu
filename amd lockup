I had the same issue for a long time. It was driving me crazy. Especially annoying as it would freeze randomly during occasional gaming session (using Steam). Freezing was reduced a lot after adding a kernel parameter, amdgpu.gpu_recovery=1. in the boot string. However, this is only the case if you are using the amdgpu driver.

Edit /etc/default/grub.

Modify the value of the variable GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to include amdgpu.gpu_recovery=1.

Run:

sudo update-grub
Reboot.
